   <p><b>Description:</b> Kakashi, a character with in the “Naruto” universe, has just narrowly escaped a dangerous war-related
     mission. During the mission, he lost one of his closest friends, Rin. It turns out that Rin was very valuable to the
     enemy, and knowing that they wanted her and not Kakashi, she jumped in the way of one of Kakashi’s attacks, effectively killing herself.
Although tragedies occur on missions all the time in the Naruto universe, this particular tragedy is very special because it
covers what the people take home with them from war. Kakashi develops PTSD, and becomes unable to activate his jutsu (powers).

   <b>Analysis:</b> In this video we see how war (which is becoming more and more prevalent today) is a disability maker in of itself. The mental health affects of war (or other traumatic experiences) on those who survive it is multifaceted, complicated and nuanced. The poem illustrates these complexities by showing the universality and the individuality of mental health, suffering and pain. Sometimes, the idea of the universal, along with the silencing stigma of mental health overshadows the individual experiences (and all of its nuance) of peoples pain and suffering.

<h2> Poem </h2>
  <br>

  Two souls asunder, naturally unique. <br>
Different bodies, different minds. <br>
Their children lost, their hearts intertwine. <br>
Connected by pain, they lament. <br>
But their aches are different, do they not understand? <br>

<br><br>

Both created unique, from a drop of sperm. <br>
Birthed by different parents, raised on different terms. <br>
Complex innerworkings, even twins aren’t the same. <br>
So how could two people ever experience the same pain? <br>
Problematic presumptions, murder in vain. <br>
<br><br>
Love breeding sacrifice, sacrifice leading to hate. <br>
But what bred oppression? Murder dealt in-vain. <br>
Love into hate, life unto death. <br>
The scars we take home, <br>
Do they become our breath? <br>
<br><br>
We are our scars? I refuse this rational. <br>
Because suffering is preventable. <br>
Silence is circumventable. <br>
The notion that my pain is irrational? <br>
Transfer souls with me, and you will see my rationale. <br>
