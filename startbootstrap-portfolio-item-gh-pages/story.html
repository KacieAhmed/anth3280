   <p>Analysis: This drawing, which was drawn by an artist called Ajgiel, features a man
     with a dark cloud over his head. The cloud symbolizes the effect depression has
     on a person’s perception of the world. It is constricting, and can cause people to have a warped,
    negative perception of the world.
The story below focuses on the “constricting” world created by depression, and how that world can intermingle and exacerbate other disorders. The constricting world itself relates to the socio-cultural idea of people with mental disorders being “trapped” inside their own head.

<h2> Story </h2>
  <br>


<br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It has been roughly 100 days since I last saw light. I’m still in this cramped, dark room, and the moans are growing louder and louder. <b> <i> “Worthless….” </i> </b> They mutter, <b> <i>  “you’re worthless”… </b> </i>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I want to scream back at them, curse them out and tell them that I’m somebody. But I’m too scared. “I have to get out of here” I think to myself. I stand up and I start to run.
 <b> <i> “You’ll never escape” </b> </i>  the voices exclaim.
I quicken my pace. I’m sprinting now, desperately trying to find some light. The walls of the dark room get further and further away the faster I go.
<b> <i> “Hahaha…” </b> </i> the voices chuckle.
I feel an arm grab my leg, and I fall face first onto the ground. The grip feels cold and damp on my calf. It takes me a second, but I eventually realize who that hand belongs to.
“No no NO NO NO NOOO” I scream.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s depression, I try to kick it away but its grip only tightens. “Please let me go” I plead. Surprisingly, it complies and loosens its hold. I instantly pull myself up right, only to be pushed back down by a large, unmistakable scolding force.
<b> <i> “BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAH” </b> </i>  I hear depression howl behind me.
I start to breakdown. I feel tears start to gush from my eyes just as the terror starts to make its way down to my spine. My tears are instantly evaporated as the large flaming hand of anxiety slaps me across the face.
The fire of anxiety starts to illuminate the would around me. I’m in a classroom. The teacher is delivering her lesson. Everyone one is quiet.
“Please no please no please no” I whisper under my breath.
<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSuddenly anxiety strangles me. I feel his scolding hands wrap around my neck.
I start to squeal. I see the class turn around to face me. I’m starting to fall into my seat. I let my head fall into my hands as I start to cry. My anxiety attack starts to kick in.
The darkness starts to surround me again. I want desperately for somebody to pull me out and give me a hug. But everyone is so distant, like they’re scared of me. I hear the dialing of a phone. “The teacher must be dialing the office” I thought to myself.
 <b> <i>  “THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO HELP YOU. YOU ARE ALL ALONE” </b> </i>  depression says in a raspy voice.
I’m in the dark room again.
