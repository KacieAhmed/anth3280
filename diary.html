<h2>Breaking the Stigma</h2>

   <p><b>Analysis:</b> The video above addresses the issue of stigma of mental health. The video highlights the fact that there is a lot of fear and uncertainty around mental health as well as a separation between mental health and physical health, as if our bodies and our minds were separate.
<br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Historically, our society created an environment whereby speaking about mental health issues could get someone put away in what was known as an asylum. Sharing one’s mental health “problems” would make them vulnerable to their family, friends and to authorities. There is a perception that the person facing a mental health problem or crisis was a danger to either themselves or to others. Thus, there is no room for an individual to simultaneously occupy the space of the normal and face mental health problems. As the video highlights, this creates a silence so that people that could otherwise be allies become too afraid to befriend the person with the mental health issue. It is this very silence that I try to critique in my Diary by showing that, despite initial stigma, a happy end can occur by breaking the social barriers that society has placed between the “normal” and “abnormal”.

<h2> Diary </h2>
  <br>


<br><br>

<b> [Monday, September 21st] </b>
Dear Diary,
The weird kid threw a tantrum today at school again, and the teachers had to come to make him stop. I kinda felt bad for him. I wanted to be his friend so he isn’t so lonely all the time, but mom said no. She said that he might bite me or something because he’s crazy. I don’t know though, to me he seems okay. I think tomorrow I’m gonna sit beside him at lunch!
<br>
<br>
<b>  [Tuesday, September 22nd] </b>
Dear Diary,
I sat beside the weird kid in class today. Turns out his name is Andy, like from Toy Story. At first, I was scared but he turned out to be super cool! He has this insane Yu-Gi-Oh card collection and let me have some of his cards. He even gave me blue eyes white dragon!! Tomorrow I’m gonna bring my cards so we can battle.
<br>
<br>
<b> [Wednesday, September 23rd] </b>
Dear Diary,
Today I found out that Andy has some serious dueling skills. He gave me all the legendary cards and still smoked me!! I asked him about his tantrums and he told me he has intermittent explosive disorder. Basically he told me that sometimes he gets really mad, like Goku when he goes super Saiyan, so he throws tantrums. I told him that maybe one day he can tame it and be like mastered super Saiyan Goku! He laughed and said maybe
<br>

<b> [Thursday, September 24th] </b>
Dear Diary,
Today Andy threw a tantrum. I was a little scared, but it was at the end of final period so he just went home with his parents after the teachers sorted everything out. I didn’t get to talk to him, but I told my dad and he let me buy a gift for Andy! I got him pokemon cards for tomorrow. I hope he likes it, cause it’s my turn to smoke him in a duel!
<br>
<br>
<b> [Friday, September 25th] </b>
Dear Diary,
I couldn’t wait to give Andy the pokemon cards, so I gave it to him first thing in the morning. He really liked them! I asked him about his super Saiyan transformation yesterday, and he told me that he handled it better than ever before so his parents took him out for ice-cream! I told him that he might actually master super Saiyan at this rate and he had a laugh over it. My friend Yousef invited us to soccer at recess so we couldn’t pokemon duel. Andy seemed to like soccer though so it was no biggie. I’m going to ask dad if it’s okay if I go over to Andy’s house so we can duel over the weekend!
